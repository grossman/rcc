<h2><em>BGP Configuration Tests as of October 2005</em></h2>
</center>


<ol>
        <li> Basic parse errors
	<ul>
          <li> undefined community-lists, as-path lists, etc.
          <li> undefined route maps
	  <li> undefined prefix-lists
	  <li> undefined distribute-lists
	  </ul>


        <p>
        <li> Tests that concern <b>validity</b> (i.e., could cause bogus
          routes to be advertised).


	  <ul>
          <li> <em>AS path prepending:</em> is the local AS prepended?  if it's
            a remote AS, the AS path is technically invalid.

          <li> <em>Next-hop reachability:</em> Is the next-hop of an
            iBGP-learned 
            route reachable via the IGP?  That is, if next-hop-self is
            not used on eBGP sessions, is the address of the external
            session in the IGP?

	    <li> <em>Prefix Filtering:</em> Do any eBGP sessions refer to
	    distribute/prefix 
	    lists that are not defined?  Does each eBGP session have a prefix
	    ACL in either a distribute/prefix list or a route map?  Are these
	    filters up-to-date with the list of <a href=>bogon prefixes</a>?

	    <li> <em>AS Path Filtering:</em> For eBGP sessions that actively
	    exchange routes to a privately numbered AS, is the private
	    AS number removed? (either with <tt>remove-private-as</tt>
	    or <tt>as-override</tt>?

	    </ul>


        <p>
        <li> Tests that concern <b>visibility</b> (i.e., could cause a
          route to not be advertised, even when a valid path exists)


	  <ul>
          <li> Is no synchronization enabled?
          <li> Are there any iBGP-related partitions?
	  <ul>
                <li> If there is no hierarchy, is iBGP full-mesh?
		<li> If route reflection is used, is the relationship of
		          route reflectors to clients acyclic?
		<li> Are route reflectors configured such that a
		          partition will exist?
                <li> If there is >1 route reflector in a cluster, do all of
                  the clients for that cluster have a session with
                  _every_ route reflector?
                <li> Are there any sessions with duplicate router-ids or
                  loopback IP addresses?
	</ul>

           <li> Are iBGP sessions between router _loopback_ addresses
             (as opposed to interface addresses)?

           <li> Are there "dangling" iBGP sessions?  i.e., iBGP sessions to
             nonexistent IP addresses?

	   <li> Are there attempts to originate a prefix with no corresponding
	   route in the routing table? (i.e., <tt>network</tt> statements
	   without <tt>route</tt> statements or appropriate redistribution.

	      </ul>

        <p>
        <li> Tests that concern <b>determinism</b>.
           
	   <ul>
          <li> Is "deterministic-med" enabled?
          <li> Is "best path compared-routerid" enabled?
          <li> Is next-hop-self used?  
	    </ul>

        <p>
	<li> Tests that concern <b>information-flow control</b>.
	<ul>
           <li> Are there "inconsistent" peering export policies?
             (ideally, an AS should export routes that look "equally
              good" at all peering points with a particular peer.)

           <li> Are there inconsistent peering import policies?
             (less important than the previous question, but good to
              figure out, since an AS may inadvertently be doing "cold
              potato" routing when it doesn't want to)

	   <li> Is network inadvertently advertising prefixes between two
	   peers?  </ul>


</ol>

<ol>
        <li> Basic parse errors
	<ul>
	</ul>
	
	<p>
	<li> Technical errors
	<ul>
	   <li> <em>MTU Mismatch</em>
	</ul>
	


        <p>
        <li> Tests that concern <b>validity</b> (i.e., could cause bogus
          routes to be advertised).
	  <ul>
          <li> <em>Mesh Group Connectivity:</em> Are all routers in the same mesh group fully connected?
	  <li> <em>Routing Level Mismatch:</em> Are routers connected by an adjacency configured for the same routing levels?
	  <li> <em>Inter-Area Routing:</em> Are routers in different areas connected by an adjacency configured for Level 2 routing?
	  </ul>


        <p>
        <li> Tests that concern <b>visibility</b> (i.e., could cause a
          route to not be advertised, even when a valid path exists)
	  <ul>
          <li> Do all routers use the same type of authentication?
          <li> Do all routers use the same auth key, if any?
	  <li> Are there any sessions with duplicate router-ids or loopback IP addresses?
          <li> Are IS-IS sessions between router _loopback_ addresses (as opposed to interface addresses)?

         <li> Are there "dangling" IS-IS sessions?  i.e., IS-IS sessions to nonexistent IP addresses?

      </ul>
