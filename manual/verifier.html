<h3>Constraint Verifier</h3>

<em>rcc</em> executes correctness checks, using the properties of the
<em>routing logic</em> as a model for correctness.  Here is a list of
<a href=tests.html>tests</a> currently performed by the verifier.
<p>

The constraint verifier performs three steps:
<ol>
<li> Expands configuration languages (e.g., Cisco's <tt>peer-group</tt>
etc.)
<li> Converts the configuration into an intermediate format, in the form
of relational database tables.
<li> Checks constraints by executing a sequence of queries on the
database tables.
</ol>


Each constraint is written as a simple SQL query.  (Please see the
development section in the <a href=manual.html>manual</a> for details.)
The flexibility of how constraints are specified permits router-specific
configuration checks, as well as AS-wide configuration checks.
<p>

We have included some examples that are included with the initial
release and fully intend to develop more as people demand more features.
Additionally, we have made the specification language simple enough that
operators can write their own checks and incorporate them into the tool
very easily.
<p>

<h3>Tests</h3>

Currently, the verifier performs the following <a href=tests.html><b>tests</b></a>.<p>

<h3>Example Output</h3>
<ul>
<li> Example <a href=examples/pbv/>output</a> from the verifier.
<br>(<em>Note:</em> the example output is from an older version of the tool,
so the output from newer versions may look slightly different.)
</ul>
