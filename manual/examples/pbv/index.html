<table align=center width=80%> <tr align=left><td> More detailed
instructions for running the verifier are in the <a
href=../../manual.html>manual</a>, but it's essentially as easy as
running a script.  The output will look something like the examples
below.

<tr><td>
<b>Next-hop reachability test.</b>  Test that, for an eBGP session,
either <tt> set next-hop-self</tt> is used or that the network
associated with the BGP session is injected into the interior routing
protocol.  Output for this test looks roughly like this:

<table width
<table align=center width=50%>
<tr><td>
<pre>
found ebgp on atlga-gw1 (AS 65000)
ebgp: no next-hop-self atlga-gw1 (10.215.0.113)
ERROR: 10.215.0.113 not in iBGP/IGP (eBGP session)
...
</pre>
</table>

<tr><td>
The first two lines are debugging lines and will typically not print
unless the debugging flag is turned on.  The last line indicates an
error condition: the IP address of the eBGP neighbor is not present in
the interior routing protocol.  This is an error, because, as indicated
by the previous line, <tt>next-hop-self</tt> is not used on the session.

<tr><td>
<b>Dangling BGP session test.</b>  Test that, for each attempted iBGP
session (i.e., <tt>bgp neighbor</tt> statement), Output for this test looks roughly like this:

<table width
<table align=center width=50%>
<tr><td>
<pre>
ERROR: no _r2 with loopback 10.0.1.65 (from bosma-gw)
ERROR: no _r2 with loopback 10.123.197.110 (from bosma-rr1)
ERROR: no _r2 with loopback 10.123.197.110 (from bosma-rr2)
...
ERROR: laxca-gw has NO "router bgp" statement
...
</pre>
</table>

<tr><td>
The first three lines show example violations.  The error condition
for a particular line indicates that there is a <tt>bgp neighbor</tt>
statement on a particular router (e.g., bosma-gw) that attempts to
establish an iBGP session to an IP address that is not the loopback
address of any router in the AS.
<p>
The fourth error line indicates that there is a router in the AS that
has no <tt>router bgp</tt> statement at all (thus, not even attempting
to establish BGP connectivity).  As this example shows, the yacc-style
rules can be network-wide, and complex enough to show exactly where (and
how) a particular error is occurring.
