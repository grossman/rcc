<h3>Control Flow Analyzer</h3>

<b>Existing Tool: Configuration Browser.</b> The control flow analyzer
is a database-backed Web interface that allows a network operator to
browse router configuration at a high-level.  For example, an
operator can view details about all BGP sessions at a particular router
in the network, all BGP sessions in the network to a particular AS,
etc.  The control flow analyzer supports the following features:
<ul>
<li> Text-based summary.
<li> Network graph in <tt>dot</tt>, edges labeled with route map
identifiers.
<ul>
<li> Restricted views: routers with eBGP sessions only, minimum degree, etc.
</ul>
<li> Database-backed Configuration Browser
<ul>
<li> BGP sessions by router
<li> BGP sessions by remote AS
<li> Route maps in normalized form
<li> "Diffs" between two route maps
<li> Sort display rows by import or export route map
</ul>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> This part of rcc only works in Cisco IOS at the moment.  We
are working on developing a new version.

<!-- <b>Ongoing work: Intent-based Specification.</b>
We believe that allowing operators to view wide-area routing
configuration at a higher level of abstraction will facilitate
configuration debugging.  Today, router configuration languages specify
<em>mechanisms</em> (e.g., access-lists, community-lists, route maps,
etc.) that implement various high-level policies, or <em>intended
behavior</em> (e.g., don't readvertise provider routes to peers, etc.).
Eventually, we believe that configuration languages should be written in
terms of intent, rather than mechanism; in the meantime, however,
today's configuration languages should be checked against a high-level
specification of intended behavior. -->
